# Code and data for the article "Ephemeral Connections, Persistent Effects: Cooperation Dynamics in Temporal Networks with Historical Interactions“

This repository contains the code and data used in the study described in the paper "Ephemeral Connections, Persistent Effects: Cooperation Dynamics in Temporal Networks with Historical Interactions". To facilitate rapid testing of the code, we have modified the Python scripts to allow execution with a single data point. The algorithms remain consistent throughout the paper, and the original results can be reproduced by simply adjusting the relevant variables and their loop structures. 

## Table of Contents
- [Code]  The scripts NetworkSL.py and NetworkER.py correspond to the code for square lattice and Erdős–Rényi random network, respectively.
- [Data]  The files labeled as "b", "α", "PC VS EC", "snapshot", and "heterogeneity" each contain the corresponding data for fig.1-fig.8 presented in the manuscript. Results pertaining to the same topic have been consolidated within a single file.
